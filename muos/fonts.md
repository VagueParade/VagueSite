# Installing the font conversion script
For themes on muOS, you can implement custom fonts! To do this, you must first install the script that will convert your
`.ttf`, `.otf`, or `.woff` type font into a specific `.bin` file that muOS will accept. 

- You will first need node.js installed. Install a pre-built packaged version of this [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer).
- Next, open up cmd (Windows) / Command Line (Linux) / Terminal (macOS), and paste this line of code to install the script;

`npm i lv_font_conv -g`

> *For macOS users, you may need to run this command as an admin. Instead, type `sudo` and then paste the code to install this.
> You may need to type in your computer's admin password.*

# Using the script
`lv_font_conv --bpp 4 --size 20 --font "username/folder/example.ttf" -r 0x20-0x7F --format bin --no-compress --no-prefilter -o "./Downloads/default.bin"`

Paste this line of code, replacing the `username/folder/example.ttf` with your font (by dragging and dropping it into your terminal window,
or pasting the file path), and you can convert your font to the right format.

This will place your font in your current user directory's Downloads folder. If you want to change this, just type in your preferred output path at the end of the command line.
- Feel free to adjust the size value. 20 is a good size for most of the elements on screen.
- Where it states `0x20-0x7f` is the range of symbols in the font.
  - 0x7f is the standard range
  - 0xff is the extended range. Some fonts may fail to convert with the extended range, but try extended range first!
  - You can go from `0x0-0xFFFF` to include _**all**_ characters within the normal range for most fonts.  You can also do `0x0-0xFFFFF` which covers a lot of unicode based glyphs too.
- bpp is used for smoothness.  4 is a good value for most fonts. You can change this to either 1, 2, 4, or 8.

> *You may have an issue generating* `.bin` *files if the font you are trying to convert has ` ` (spaces) in the path.
> In place of them, you can get* `\` *(backslashes). On macOS (and potentially on the other systems), this will not work.
> You will need to first rename the* `.ttf` *file (and folders leading to the file) removing spaces in order to remove backslashes.*

If you want to learn more about this type of font conversion, or for more details on this script, see the [lv_font_conv GitHub repository](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_font_conv).

# Install Custom Fonts
Within the `./font/` folder, you can drop in a compiled font here either named `default.bin` or `mux_example.bin` according
to whichever program you'd like that individual font to be used for. Check out the naming conventions in the Theme Structure page.
